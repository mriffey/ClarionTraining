Audience:

Developer(s) who know a programming language other than Clarion. This outline doesn’t have to teach programming, Git, or similar fundamentals.

Developer(s) who have completed the C11 tutorials and reviewed the examples. The examples are all / mostly appgen, but I figure it cant hurt much to review them.

Field equates / the use of std Clarion equates
Use of EQUATE in general for making code understandable. See also “what MG says” :slight_smile:
